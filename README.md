## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Explore and practice different programming languages and frameworks.
- Build functional, interactive, and visually appealing mini-projects.
- Showcase learning progress and experiment with new ideas.

---

## Features

- Each project is self-contained with its own **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** files (or Python scripts if applicable).
- Projects are easy to run locally by opening the respective `index.html` or running Python scripts.
- Responsive designs and interactive functionality where applicable.

---

## Future Plans

- Add a **Weather App** that fetches live weather data using APIs.
- Include Python mini-projects like small scripts or games.
- Expand projects to include **advanced JavaScript, API integrations, and frameworks**.
